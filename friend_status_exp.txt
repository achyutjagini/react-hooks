
In this example, ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus logs a message indicating 
that it has subscribed to the friend's status, and after 2 seconds it calls the 
handleStatusChange callback with an object indicating that the friend is online.

ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus logs a message indicating that it has
unsubscribed from the friend's status.

This code is a simple example of how to use React's useEffect hook to 
subscribe to a friend's 
online status. The code uses the ChatAPI to subscribe to the friend's status and 
receive updates. The useEffect hook is used to handle the side effects that occur
when the component is first rendered and when it unmounts.

The useEffect hook takes a callback function that is executed after the component 
is rendered. In this case, the callback uses the ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus
method to subscribe to updates on the friend's status, and the 
ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus
method to unsubscribe when the component unmounts.

The useState hook is used to store the friend's current status in the isOnline state
variable. The handleStatusChange function updates the isOnline state with the new 
status when it is received from the ChatAPI.

Finally, the component returns 'Loading...' when the status is not yet available 
and returns 'Online' or 'Offline' depending on the friend's current status.

The code creates a React root using ReactDOM.createRoot and renders the FriendStatus
component into the "mydiv" container element.


This is a simple JavaScript code that defines an object named "ChatAPI". The object has
 two methods, subscribeToFriendStatus and unsubscribeFromFriendStatus.

The subscribeToFriendStatus method takes two arguments, friendId and handleStatusChange. 
When the method
is called, it logs a message to the console indicating that a subscription has been made for a 
friend with the specified friendId. It then sets a timeout for 2 seconds and, when it 
elapses, calls the handleStatusChange function and passes an object with an isOnline
property set to true as an argument.

The unsubscribeFromFriendStatus method takes two arguments, friendId and 
handleStatusChange. When the method is called, it logs a message to the console
indicating that a subscription has been unsubscribed for a friend with the specified friendId.

It is likely that this code is part of a larger application that is using 
this ChatAPI object to handle subscriptions for friend statuses in a chat system.


setTimeout(() => {
            //argument is arrow function which calls handleStatusChange function 
            //passes an object as argument

            handleStatusChange(
            //object with isOnline property set to true as argument
            {
              isOnline: true
            }
            );
          },
          2000);

This is a JavaScript code that sets a timeout for 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds) 
using the setTimeout function.

The setTimeout function takes two arguments: a callback function and a delay
in milliseconds. In this case, the callback function is an arrow function 
that calls the handleStatusChange function and passes an object with an
isOnline property set to true as an argument.

After 2 seconds, the setTimeout function will invoke the callback function,
which will in turn trigger the handleStatusChange function. The handleStatusChange
function is passed the object with the isOnline property, which it can use
to update the status of a friend in a chat system.


function FriendStatus(props) {
    const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = React.useState(null);
  
    function handleStatusChange(status) 
    {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }

This is a functional component in React that renders the status of a friend in a chat system.

The component has a state variable, isOnline, that is initialized using the useState hook from React.
The useState hook takes a single argument, which is the initial value of the state. In this case, 
the initial value of isOnline is null.

The component also has a function named handleStatusChange that takes a single argument, status. 
This function is called when the friend's status changes and updates the state variable isOnline
using the setIsOnline function returned from the useState hook.

The handleStatusChange function sets the value of isOnline to the value of status.isOnline, which is passed to it as an argument.

This component is likely to be used in combination with the ChatAPI object to subscribe to
and unsubscribe from updates to the status of a friend in a chat system.


This is a code snippet written in React using the useEffect hook.

The useEffect hook is used to add and manage the side effects in your functional components.
In this case, the side effect is subscribing to the status changes of a friend through 
the ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus method.

The handleStatusChange function is passed as a callback to this method, which will 
be called every time the friend's status changes.

The return statement inside the useEffect hook specifies a cleanup function. This function 
is executed before the component is unmounted, or before the next render. In this case, the
 cleanup function is unsubscribing from the friend's status updates using the 
 ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus method.

By doing this, we can ensure that the subscription and unsubscription
 are properly managed and that we avoid any memory leaks in our application.


 The reason "Unsubscribed from friend with id 10" is not outputted twice is
  because the ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus method is being called
   inside the useEffect cleanup function.

In React, the useEffect cleanup function is called when a component is unmounted or re-rendered.
When the component is re-rendered, the cleanup function from the previous render is called before
the new useEffect hook is executed.

So, in this case, when the component is re-rendered, the cleanup function will be called
first and will log "Unsubscribed from friend with id 10". This will 
ensure that the previous 
subscription is cleaned up before a new one is created during the next render.


No, the state variable isOnline can only be modified by calling setIsOnline within 
the function component. State variables are designed to be private to the component 
and their values can only be changed using the setState or useState
function within the component.
