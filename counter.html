<!--
Here, useState is a Hook (we’ll talk about what this means in a moment). We call it inside
a function component to add some local state to it. React will preserve this state between
re-renders. useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that
lets you update it. 
You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It’s similar
to this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together. 
(We’ll show an example comparing useState to this.state in Using the State Hook.)

The only argument to useState is the initial state. In the example above, it is 0 because 
our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike this.state, the state here doesn’t have to 
be an object — although it can be if you want. The initial state argument is only 
used during the first render.-->
