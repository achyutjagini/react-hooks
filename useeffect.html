<!--When you call useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing 
changes to the DOM. 

Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its
props and state.

By default, React runs the effects after every render — including the 
first render. (We’ll talk more about how this compares to class lifecycles in 
Using the Effect Hook.)

Effects may also optionally specify how to “clean up” after them by returning a function. 
For example, this component uses an effect to subscribe to a friend’s online status, and 
cleans up by unsubscribing from it:-->

<!--
there is three cases in useEffect 
if you pass 
empty dependency array -> it will run everytime the component mounted
no dependency array ->  only run on first render
some values inside dependency arr -> run when the values inside the arr changes. 

useEffect is usually used in api calls and changing accordingly
https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useEffect

The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component.
It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount 
in React classes, but unified into a single API. (We’ll show examples comparing useEffect 
to these methods in using the Effect Hook.)

<div id="mydiv"></div>
<script type="text/babel">

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
const container=document.getElementById("mydiv");
const root =ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Example/>);
